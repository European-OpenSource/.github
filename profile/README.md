## ðŸ’™ About Us

> Building Europe's open-source future

**European OpenSource** is the first platform connecting European developers, companies, and institutions to share code, knowledge, and innovative ideas.

Our mission is to transform fragmentation into concrete collaboration, promoting software reuse and generating positive social impact. We believe in open-source as an ethical and sustainable model for building an independent and secure European digital future.
